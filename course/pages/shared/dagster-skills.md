# AI-assisted development with Dagster Skills

Building data pipelines involves many patterns and best practices that can be tedious to implement from scratch. The [Dagster Skills](https://github.com/dagster-io/skills) project accelerates your development workflow by providing AI assistant skills that generate Dagster code following best practices.

## Why learn the fundamentals first?

The patterns and best practices covered in Dagster University courses—assets, resources, partitions, ingestion, testing, and more—are programmed directly into Dagster Skills. When you use these AI tools, they apply the same principles you've learned here.

Understanding these fundamentals helps you:

- **Review AI-generated code effectively** — You'll know what good Dagster code looks like and can spot issues
- **Customize code for your needs** — AI provides a starting point, but business logic nuances require human judgment
- **Debug when things go wrong** — Knowing how Dagster concepts work under the hood helps you troubleshoot

Once you understand the fundamentals, Dagster Skills can significantly accelerate your workflow by generating scaffolding and boilerplate for you.

## Compatible tools

Dagster Skills is compatible with:

- Claude Code
- Cursor
- Windsurf
- Codex
- Other Agent Skills-compatible tools

## What Dagster Skills can help with

Once [installed](https://github.com/dagster-io/skills?tab=readme-ov-file#installation), you can ask your AI assistant to help with a variety of Dagster tasks. The AI will analyze your code and generate code that follows the patterns from Dagster University courses:

- Creating and structuring assets with proper dependencies
- Configuring resources for external systems
- Setting up partitions for time-based or categorical data
- Configuring schedules and sensors for automation
- Adding asset checks for data quality validation
- Leveraging integrations in your stack
- Implementing tests with `materialize()` and mock resources

Dagster Skills helps you integrate best practices into your workflow by generating code that follows the same patterns taught in Dagster University. While AI accelerates the process, the fundamentals you've learned ensure you can review, customize, and maintain that code effectively.
